# Neural Network Implementation for MNIST 

This repository holds a neural network implementation made from scratch using modern C++. The aim was to experiment with different Neural Network operations, hyperparameters and configurations to better understand how they work. For this, I chose the MNIST dataset as it is a simple and well-known example to focus on.

## Features

Although the project started out as a simple neural network implementation to be trained on the MNIST dataset, it quickly evolved into something closer to a library. Currently, there are multiple configurations and parameters that can be set to trigger different techniques of machine learning using neural networks.
